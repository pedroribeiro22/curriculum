## Me
I'm a Braga based software engineer student and web designer aspirant looking to get my work out. If you want to know a bit more about my work just follow the link below in order to get to my web resume as well as my PDF one.

## What is this ...
This repository is somewhat of my way of developing some skils in HTML as well as CSS. Hopefuly it is some other way to give visibility to some of the work I've developed as well as the work I'm about to develop.
